### Abstract
Monitoring the gun violence activities in NYC is the main problem
that will be assessed in the project. We will draw out conclusions
taking the impact of the pandemic into account as well as the historic
data. Also, we are going to take into considerations various
other factors such as socio-economic impact an area has on such
incidents, jurisdiction, time of occurrence of such events, perpetrator
background, etc. to list a few. Another important factor we will
be examining is the impact of occurrence of such events before and
after the Covid-19 pandemic to answer a few questions like if there
is a decrease in the count of such incidents or did it increase? are
there any other factors contributing to the growth or decline in gun
violence? We propose to study the occurrence and trends of such
activities over the period of 2006 to 2020 in New York City but on a
more detailed level to understand what is the most common time
or location of such activities and which people are involved keeping
into mind a variety of factors such as socio-economic impact,
income groups, age groups, gender, race etc.
